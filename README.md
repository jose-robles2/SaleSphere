# Cpts422-WebApp

## Project
This project is a marketplace web application, similar in functionality to eBay. For the first phase of our project, we're planning to keep things simple. We'll start by displaying a list of different products and add filters to help users easily find what they're looking for. Next, we'll set up basic user accounts that include a username, password, and name. After we get these basic features up and running, we'll look into adding more functionalities to enrich the user experience.

## Technologies
Java, Spring MVC, JUnit, Selenium, IntelliJ, Maven
